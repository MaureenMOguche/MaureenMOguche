Hey there, I'm Maureen, a full-stack software developer with experience in C# ASP.NET (both MVC and REST APIs) and Angular. I enjoy working on projects that help people and make the world a better place, so I'm always open to collaborating on volunteer projects.

While I'm comfortable working in any industry, I have a special interest in the banking and fintech industry, as well as the geoinformation sector. I'm excited about the potential of technology to revolutionize how we understand and interact with the world around us.

Check out my GitHub projects to see some of my work, and feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project together!
